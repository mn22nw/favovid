# Project for my course RIA-development with JavaScript  2DV607

```
**Description**  
This the beginning of my favovid app.   [VIEW DEMO](http://mn22nw.github.io/favovid/)     
The distribution files are located in the gh-pages branch 


It's a bit messy at the moment, with some code and modules that wont be there later, but I thought I could put it up anyways...

**Whats up next:**  

* Fix navigation (the current menu-link should not be clickable)
* I'm planning on connecting to firebase and get youtubeIds from there instead of json
* Implement log in 
* Use the youtube api instead of just adding iframes. 
* Figure out how to make use of Redux in a good way.
